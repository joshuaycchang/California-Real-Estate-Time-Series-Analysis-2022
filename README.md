# California Real Estate Time Series Analysis 2022
 Performed time series forecast on the California housing market in San Diego, Los Angeles, San Franscisco, and California as a whole from 2013 to 2022. Ran Naive, Seasonal Naive, Holt-Winters', and Neural Networks models. Found that ARIMA model produced the best results when comparing the RMSE and MAPE values between the models. Found that real estate prices in all cities and the state overall had a very strong positive correlation with S&P 500 Index (about 97 to 98% but a weak negative correlation with the U.S. GDP (about -19% to -22%). Overall, found that though the SF Bay Area has a higher prediction error (RMSE) than the other cities, prices on average are $500k-$700k greater than that of the other two cities. If real estate developers or real estate investors want to build or purchase a home in one of these cities, SF Bay Area is the best option. Else, if they are more risk averse, LA should be the best (with an average prediction error (RMSE) of about $55k.
